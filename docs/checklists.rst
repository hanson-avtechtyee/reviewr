Checklists
==========

Checklists are entities in reviewr that provide a common form for review content.  You can create, edit, and disable checklists, but without admin privilieges, you cannot remove them.  The intent is if a checklist is updated as part of new plans or standards, either the checklist revision must be changed (edit) or a new checklist must be created (new).

Creating Checklists
------------

It is recommended that all checklists used first go through an independent review process before being created.  This can be accomplished within reviewr by creating a review checklist for plans and standards that includes the document type checklist content.

Editing Checklists
------------

To revise a checklist, you must have sufficient privileges to do so.  The Project Leader role has rights to edit checklists, but Project Members do not.  

The reviewr tool will automatically record the "Changed By", and "Changed On" fields for edits to a checklist, but it allows the "Revision" field to be free text, up to 4 characters.
